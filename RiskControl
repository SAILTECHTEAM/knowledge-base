# High-Risk / Failed Project Takeover Playbook  
**Version:** v1_20251227

---

## Purpose

To regain control of a failing or rejected project by stabilizing trust, reconstructing reality, and delivering early proof of capability — **before attempting full recovery**.

---

## Phase 0 | Reality Reconstruction

**Goal:**  
Stop operating on assumptions.

### Key Questions
1. What can we **actually deliver right now**? (Ignore promises and plans)
2. What does the client **truly care about**? (Ignore documents and specs)
3. Why was the previous output **rejected**? (Focus on mismatch, not blame)

### Output
- A concise **Current Situation Overview**, usable both internally and externally.

### Principle
> You cannot fix a project until you reconstruct reality as it is.

---

## Phase 1 | Trust Stabilization (Within 48 Hours)

**Goal:**  
Buy time by reducing uncertainty.

This phase is **not about technology**. It is about trust.

### Actions
- Proactively contact the client.
- Admit uncertainty and existing problems honestly.
- Clearly state what the client can expect in the **next 7–14 days**.

### Key Sentence
> “We will first deliver a verifiable interim result to confirm direction, before expanding the system further.”

### Why This Matters
- Technical recovery is impossible once trust collapses.
- Transparency reduces perceived risk more effectively than false confidence.

---

## Phase 2 | Cut Complexity & Signal Capability  
**(MVP with Intent)**

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate control and competence as quickly as possible.

### Actions
- Produce a **clear process flow diagram** (to help the client regain control).
- Identify **1–2 sub-deliverables** that best demonstrate capability.
- Deliver **fast**, even if the result is incomplete.

### Principle
> Do not optimize for completeness.  
> Optimize for **confidence restoration**.

---

## Phase 3 | Feedback-Driven Iteration

**Goal:**  
Adapt based on real signals, not internal opinions.

### Actions
- Treat all feedback as data.
- Update priorities based on **client reaction**, not sunk cost.
- Be willing to discard previous approaches.

### Operating Model
- Short iteration cycles
- Early validation
- Continuous direction correction

---

## Core Principle of the Playbook

You are not fixing code first.

You are stabilizing a system composed of **people, expectations, and trust**.

---

## Suggested Usage

If any project encounters serious issues, **before writing any code**, first open a page titled:

> **“Takeover Phase Checklist”**

and follow this playbook step by step.

# Result Ownership Evaluation & Talent Classification Framework

---

## Purpose

To distinguish between **execution capability** and **result responsibility**,  
and to prevent high-risk work from being assigned to the wrong profile.

---

## Result Ownership Matrix

### Level 1 — Executor

**Characteristics**
- Requests clear specifications
- Performs assigned tasks accurately
- Explains reasons when things fail

**Risk Profile**
- Low autonomy
- Safe only in well-defined scopes

**Suitable For**
- Stable execution
- Clearly scoped tasks

---

### Level 2 — Analyst

**Characteristics**
- Can diagnose problems
- Provides detailed analysis
- Avoids making final decisions

**Risk Profile**
- Escalates responsibility upward
- Hesitant under ambiguity

**Suitable For**
- Support roles
- Advisory capacity

---

### Level 3 — Result Owner (Critical Role)

**Characteristics**
- Proactively defines assumptions
- Articulates trade-offs and risks
- Takes responsibility for outcomes
- Focuses on **what to change next** after failure

**Risk Profile**
- Accepts uncertainty
- Accountable for consequences

**Suitable For**
- Architecture decisions
- Client-facing ownership
- High-ambiguity projects

---

## Three Mandatory Evaluation Questions  
*(For interviews, performance reviews, or conflict resolution)*

### Q1 — Ambiguity Test

**Question**  
> “If the requirements are unclear, how would you proceed?”

- ✅ **Result Owner:** Proposes assumptions and validation steps  
- ❌ **Process-Oriented:** Waits for specifications

---

### Q2 — Failure Responsibility Test

**Question**  
> “If this fails, where do you think the biggest risk lies?”

- ✅ **Result Owner:** Identifies risk and mitigation  
- ❌ **Process-Oriented:** Explains why failure would not be their responsibility

---

### Q3 — Decision Test (Most Important)

**Question**  
> “If you were responsible for the final decision, how would you design it?”

Anyone who redirects blame or avoids committing  
→ **Not a Result Owner**

---

## Key Management Rule

Do **not** ask:

> “Is this person capable?”

Ask instead:

> **“Am I willing to let this person own the consequences?”**
